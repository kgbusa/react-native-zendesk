[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/react-native-zendesk-v2.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/react-native-zendesk-v2/)

React native wrapper for zendesk unified SDK. Supports both iOS and Android platforms.

## VERSIONS

It's an alpha version release as of now and only tested on RN >=0.61.0. Bugs and issues can be there.

## Getting Started

### Manual install

1. With npm:

   `npm install react-native-zendesk-v2`

   or with yarn:

   `yarn add react-native-zendesk-v2`

#### iOS

2. Pod Install:

   then run pod install: `(cd ios; pod install)`

   or manually:

   In Xcode, drag and drop `node_modules/react-native-zendesk-chat/RNZendeskChat.m` and `node_modules/react-native-zendesk-chat/RNZendeskChat.h` into your project.

#### Android

You need to add this in your root build.gradle under allProjects -> repositories file of the project.
`maven { url 'https://zendesk.jfrog.io/zendesk/repo' }`

## Usage

In your code add:

Step 1. import RNZendeskChat from 'react-native-zendesk'

### Initialisation

Place this code at the root of your application to initialize Zendesk SDK.

For all supported SDKs

```javascript
RNZendeskChat.init({
	key: <chatAccountKey>,
	appId: <appId>,
	url: <zendeskUrl>,
	clientId: <zendeskClientId>,
})
```

If you just want ChatSDK use this instead:
`RNZendeskChat.initChat('<chatAccountKey>')`

Step 2. Set user identifier

- If your chat just runs behind a login you can pass in name and email whenever user logins if not, pass a JWT Token to identify the user on chat

```
	RNZendeskChat.setUserIdentity({
		name: <name>,
		email: <email>,
	})
```

- If you want to start chat without any user details you can use a JWT token.

```
	RNZendeskChat.setUserIdentity({
		token: <JWT TOKEN>
	})
```

Step 3. Show the UI based on what SDK you want to use

### Debugging

To enable debug logs, use the following method:

```javascript
RNZendeskChat.setLogging(true);
```

### Chat SDK

\*\* To use chat sdk without answer bot, please add `chatOnly: true` in this method

```
	RNZendeskChat.startChat({
		name: user.full_name,
		email: user.email,
		phone: user.mobile_phone,
		tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
		department: "Your department"
	});
```

| Props      | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name       | Name of the user                                                      |
| email      | Email of the user                                                     |
| phone      | Phone number of the user                                              |
| tags       | Some specific tags you want to associate with the chat                |
| department | Any department you want to associate chat with                        |
| chatOnly   | If you just want to start the ChatSDK and not answer or support SDKs. |
| botName    | The botname you want to show on your chat                             |
| color      | Primary color (hex code) for chat bubbles only on iOS                 |

### Help Center (with and Without Chat SDK)

To initiate and display help center use the following method:

```
RNZendesk.showHelpCenter({
	withChat: true // add this if you want to use chat instead of ticket creation
	disableTicketCreation: true // add this if you want to just show help center and not add ticket creation
})
```

You can use either of these options `withChat` or `disableTicketCreation`, both can't be used together.

_NOTE: Zendesk support with chat enabled is currently buggy, I am trying to resolve that issue. At present you can show help center with normal ticket creation._
Working on currently adding more config options here and add customising properties.

### Reset visitor details

To reset the visitor details to a clean slate allowing a new visitor to chat, use the following method:

```javascript
await RNZendeskChat.resetUserIdentity();
```

Any ongoing chat will be ended, and locally stored information about the visitor will be cleared.

### Set Chat Identity

To authenticate a user with the Chat SDK, you first need to ensure you have created your Chat JWT Authentication endpoint. See https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408836328346#topic_mgm_vpy_4fb for more details. Then you can call your JWT endpoint which will return a JWT Token which you will use to set the chat identity:

```
RNZendeskChat.setChatIdentity(<JWT TOKEN>);
```

### Customising Looks

For styling in android create a theme in your android folder with the following properties

```
<style  name="ZendeskTheme"  parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light">

<item  name="colorPrimary">@color/primary</item>

<item  name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/primary</item>

<item  name="colorAccent">@color/primary</item>

</style>
```

And then add following to your project's AndroidManifest.xml file (use only the SDKs you use)

```
      <activity android:name="zendesk.support.guide.HelpCenterActivity"
            android:theme="@style/ZendeskTheme" />

        <activity android:name="zendesk.support.guide.ViewArticleActivity"
            android:theme="@style/ZendeskTheme" />

        <activity android:name="zendesk.support.request.RequestActivity"
            android:theme="@style/ZendeskTheme" />

        <activity android:name="zendesk.support.requestlist.RequestListActivity"
            android:theme="@style/ZendeskTheme" />
        <activity android:name="zendesk.messaging.MessagingActivity"
            android:theme="@style/ZendeskTheme" />
```

For iOS only added a new function which can be used as below. This would set the primary color for the chat and other sdks

```
	RNZendesk.setPrimaryColor(<hex color string>)

```

### Push notifications

For push notifications added a method to register token in Zendesk, all other handling and stuff needs to be done on the app itself.
To register your token with Zendesk call

```
	RNZendesk.setNotificationToken(<your token>)
```
